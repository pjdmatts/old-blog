I think I might be using Twitter wrong.

The way I have been *tweeting* is to post things I find interesting or useful - using the tool more as a 'note to self' than anything else. This runs somewhat contrary to the notion of a non-stop *cocktail party*. 

With that said though I have never been to many cocktail parties - so I have no reference point - and I find it hard to think of a tool that can help fuel an uprising as a *party*.

Another model might be of the *Exocortex* - an augmentation of ones memory and processing capabilities through digital means. This fits more with the breadcrumbs I have been leaving for myself. 

But that strikes me as grandiose. Better to view Twitter as an all purpose dumping ground for thoughts and opinions. A great never ending surface onto which any and all variety of thought are projected - including my note pour moi-mÃªme if thats what I decide. In short it's graffiti. 

There's no *right way* that I know of to scrawl something on a wall where someone else might read it.
