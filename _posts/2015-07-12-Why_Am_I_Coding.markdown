The world is full of people learning to code, or at least it seems that way. It could also be that to someone learning to code it looks like everyone is learning to code, because their world now consists to a large part of people who either can code or are learning to.

My reasons for learning are probably very similar to other people on a similar journey. But here is why I spend my free time at a keyboard:

1, It is fun. During my Day Job a source of tremendous satisfaction is the *try it - fix it - try it again - it works!* loop when tinkering with a spreadsheet.

2, It is necessary. There are tools I need in my day job that the IT team don't have time to build. And the things they do build for us take a *long* time. So I am going to explore what it takes to build my own tools.

3, I am already doing it. In one way or another I have been on the fringes for a long time. The matlab code I post on this site comes from experiments I have run at work and at home and the spreasheet fiddling I mention above has evolved into custom functions and scripts in VBA.

4, It fits. I have a physics degree and have always maintained an interest in things analytic/numeric. This is a long winded way of saying I am somewhat of a nerd.

So really the learning journey comes down drawing some outlines around who I already am. Taking curiosities and interests and turning them into actual skills.
