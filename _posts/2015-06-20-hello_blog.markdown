This is a foray into blogging using [Jekyll][jekyll] and [GitHub Pages][github].

The main intent here is to:

1, Get some practice using Jekyll and blogging in general

2, Keep some useful notes on things I look up and learn. This is for my own reference,
but may also prove useful for other learners looking up the same things I did.

3, Also, something along the lines of what Oscar Wilde had Gwendolen say:

>I never travel without my diary. One should always have something sensational to read in the train.
