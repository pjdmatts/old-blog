This is a collection of resources I have found useful so far. More of an aide-memoire than a comprehensive list, but hopefully some of these will be useful to you too.

Category     | Resource     | Notes    |
:------- | :------- | :----- |
Where I Started | [One Month Rails](https://onemonth.com/courses/one-month-rails) | A fun course. The only drawback is the fast pace. You can keep up but you don't get much time to look around. When you are ‘done’ you have a working application and a certificate. But something needs to step up and say ‘OK, now do this next’ |
Where I Started | [Rails Guides](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/) | Tutorials and books can be a bit too conversational. The guides seem to be a very efficient approach to getting you what you need to know on a specific topic. But you need books and tutorials so that you know what to look up in the guides |
Where I Started | [e-mails from Justin Weiss](http://www.justinweiss.com/) | I signed up for his e-mail series. These lead up to a pitch for his book, Practicing Rails, but between the e-mails and his blog archive he has a lot advice on what to do next: e.g. "What to do after you run rails new” |
Where I Started | [e-mails from Ben at Upcase](https://upcase.com/pages/land-your-dream-rails-job) | This e-mail series is a really great long view to getting a job coding in Rails |
